🤖 As a Machine Learning/AI Engineer, I'm passionate about the power of data. However, the phrase "garbage in, garbage out" highlights a critical issue: the strength of our data-driven conclusions depends on the quality of our data.

🔍 Data Gaps in Healthcare: Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women, yet only 38% of research study participants are women. This leads to treatment gaps and higher mortality rates. Data literacy is key – asking the right questions ensures relevant, useful data.

### 🚫  **Addressing Bias**

Historical reasons and media representations impact data participation. Examining bias is crucial for sound science. Asking who participated, who is left out, and who made the data uncovers hidden biases.

📊 **Understanding Statistics**: Data literacy shines in the legal system. Elaine Shoben used statistics to shift the burden of proof to companies in hiring discrimination cases. Statistical analysis helps reveal systematic patterns, proving discrimination beyond individual cases.

📈 **High Stakes Visualizations**: The Challenger disaster showcases the importance of data visualization. Engineers' visualizations lacked clarity, leading to a tragic launch. A better visualization would have made the danger apparent, emphasizing the role of good data literacy in decision-making.

🔢 **Numeracy Matters**: Understanding numbers without context is challenging. Analysts provide clarity and context, ensuring audiences comprehend the real-life impact of data. Powers of ten make a significant difference – a million vs. a billion is not a trivial distinction.

🔗 **Causal Analysis and John Snow's cholera theory**: Correlation does not equal causation. Dr. John Snow's groundbreaking work in cholera epidemiology demonstrates the power of causal analysis. Stay tuned for Part 2 to uncover how Dr. Snow linked contaminated water to a cholera outbreak.

### Final Thoughts

🌐 Conclusion: Embracing data literacy is pivotal for engineers, analysts, and decision-makers. It shapes a future where data gaps are closed, biases are addressed, and impactful decisions are made. Let's bridge the gaps together!
